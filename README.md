## Introduction
The Weather Dashboard App is a web application built with React.js that allows users to search for and view current weather conditions for up to five cities at a time. The app displays detailed information, including the current temperature, weather conditions (sunny, cloudy, rainy, etc.), high and low temperatures, and a 3-day forecast for each city. Users can also add new cities to the dashboard and remove existing ones.

This application is designed to be responsive, making it accessible on both desktop and mobile devices. It handles API requests to OpenWeather for weather data, and includes error handling in case the API fails.
